# **AeroCET SAE ISS Drone Development Competition 2025**

## Overview

This repository contains the design, analysis, and fabrication documentation for the AeroCET team's entry in the SAE India Southern Section (SAE ISS) Drone Development Competition (DDC) 2025. The objective of our project is to develop a high-performance RC aircraft while adhering to the fabrication constraints and competition rulebook.

## Project Summary
The aircraft was designed with a focus on aerodynamic efficiency, stability, and manufacturability. Key aspects of our approach include:

**Airfoil Selection:** Optimized wing and tail surfaces for aerodynamic efficiency.

**Electronic Components:** Selection of lightweight, high-performance components.

**Structural Design:** Fuselage length estimation and material optimization.

**Performance Analysis:** Stability and flight simulations using XFLR5, Ansys, and XFOIL.

**Manufacturing Process:** Laser-cut wooden components, carbon fiber reinforcements, and precise assembly.

**Cost Estimation:** A breakdown of material and fabrication expenses.
